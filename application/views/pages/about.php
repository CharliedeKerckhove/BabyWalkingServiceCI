        <h4 id = "abouttxt">Everybody needs a break from the demands of new babies and the stresses of daily living, mums and dads are no exception! One of the biggest factors leading to tension and issues in relationships after childbirth is tiredness. Lack of sleep can have a huge impact on day-to-day life, so think of this service as <b>self-preservation</b>. <br><br> Giving yourself permission to slow down and relax for a few moments a day, or a few hours each week will help you to reflect and gain a fresh outlook. The purpose of this Baby Walking service is to give new parents 1 - 2 hours of &#34;me time&#34;  to go to the gym, have a power nap, have a bubble bath, go shopping, get a pedicure or simply do nothing (Yes, you are allowed!)</h4>
